## 		This script is written for use in the Blender
## Game Engine. All you have to do to install it into
## an object is create an Always sensor with 0 pulse
## setting (necessary for correct time calculation)
## and set the always sensor to a controller set to a simple script
## that sets the animation. That is all that is necessary to run it;
## To see the benefit, though, you must also UV-map said object
## object to a sprite image on a sprite sheet.
##
## To define an animation for use in the Sprite() function, use the following format:
##
## anim = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2]
##
## In the format above, the animation is defined as a list, and the
## numbers indicate how the animation plays. The first number is the
## sprite cell column to be drawn using the UV-map you set for the
## sprite object earlier. The remaining numbers are used to define
## which frame to play, and when. In the above example, first, frame 0
## would display, then 1, then 2, then 3, and finally, 2 again. After this,
## the animation repeats. 

## To define an animation for use in the SpriteMesh() function, use the following format:

## anim = ['MarkWalk', 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## In the format above, the animation is again defined as a list. However, in this
## animation format, the first value is the base name of the mesh to swap out to achieve
## animation - the first mesh used would be 'MarkWalk0', and then 'MarkWalk1', and so on.
## Name meshes in a hidden layer after these frames, and the animation will play through.
## There's an example present in the blend files that come with this script.

## To set the object's animation to an animation, use
## the obj['currentanim'] variable to set the object's currently displayed
## animation to another defined animation. For example:
##
## obj['spranim'] = anim
##
## Would set the object's currently displayed animation to the anim variable,
## which has already been defined above. That is it; Note that the object
## for the sprite will only display the sprite on the FIRST face.

## After defining and setting an animation, run the matching sprite function, and that's it:

## Sprite(obj) # Note that obj can be omitted, as it will
## assume that you mean the object if you don't define which one in particular.

## NOTE that you don't have to call SpriteInit(), as the animation functions will call it when necessary.

## Here are the variables to manipulate the sprite with

## (note that they are accessed using obj['variablename']:
##
## sprsubimage
##
## Indicates which frame of the animation the sprite is showing - note that in
## the example animation [0, 1, 5, 9], if subimage = 2, then the current frame
## drawing is 5. To set the subimage of a animation directly, simply set the variable.
##
## sprpastsubimage
##
## Indicates which frame of the animation was last drawn (one script-run ago).
## This would be the past game frame if the frequency of the script was 0 (every
## game frame).
## 
## sprfps
##
## Indicates how quickly the animation should advance (how many
## frames per second for the animation).
##
## sprflipx / sprflipy
##
## Indicates whether the sprite should be flipped on the
## X-axis (left-to-right), or the Y-axis (top-to-bottom). Note that when
## SpriteMesh is used, this physically flips the sprite around on the Z-axis,
## while if the Sprite function is used, then the UV-maps are flipped.
##
## sprrotate
##
## Rotates the sprite around on the local Y-axis 
##
## spractiveface and spractivemesh
##
## activeface tells which face to animate for the active mesh indicated
## by none other than activemesh

## CHANGE-LOG

## 10/15/11 - Fixed some incorrect width-setting code in the SpriteInit() function. :P

## 11/13/11 - Deleted the 'sprwait' variable; now only the sprsubimage variable is used, and it's expressed in fractions... Marvelous.
## However, this makes changing subimages as easy as pie! Just use the sprsubimage variable.

## 1/10/12 - Documentation and stuff.

def SpriteInit(spriteobj=None, override=0):
    """
    Initializes the values for sprite animation; you can alter these values as you wish, though
    it would be best not to alter certain values (sprvert, sprw or sprh (they get their values from the UV-map info), or sprfreqorig).

    You can override the initialization process to ensure that it is initialized on a given frame, regardless of whether it has been
    initialized or not, as well, by setting override to 1.



    *NOTE*: It's not necessary to call this function yourself, as the sprite animation functions below (Sprite and SpriteMesh) already
    call them as necessary (once when the sprite needs to be animated).



    Object variables created are:

    spranim = Animation array
    sprfps = How many frames to display a second
    sprflipx, sprflipy = Flipping the sprite on the respective axes using the object's orientation matrix.

    sprrotate = Rotation of the sprite in radians (around, on the local Y-axis). Doesn't get added to the sprite's original rotation.
    Also, note that this doesn't work with Halo-enabled faces; they always face 'downwards'. To fix this, rotate the frame in
    Blender before game play.
    For example, if rotate = math.pi, then the sprite should rotate 180 degrees around, so that it's upside down and facing left.

    sprcamoptimize = Whether to slow down the connected sensor's frequency if the sprite goes out of frame
    sprfpslock = Whether to lock the sprite's animation speed to the logic tic rate (the target FPS) or rather
    synchronize to the game's actual FPS rate; defaults to locking the animation rate to the actual game FPS

    sprsubimage = Which frame of the sprite to display. Initialized to 1.
    sprpastsubimage = The last frame of the sprite that was displayed the last time this function was run.

    This function's arguments:

    spriteobj = Which object to initialize sprite variables on
    override = Defaults to 0; if set to 1, then the sprite values will be created or set, regardless of whether it happened already or not.
